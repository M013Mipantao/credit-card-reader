Prototype.js Based Javascript Credit Card Reader

This code will listen for data sent by a magnetic credit card reader to the browser and format it for easy use.

Usage:

  // Create a new reader instance
  var reader = new CreditCardReader();

  // Feed it an object to observe (this could also be a textbox)
  reader.observe(document.body);

  // Errback in case of a reading error
  reader.cardError(function () {
  	// card swipe error
  });

  reader.cardRead(function (data) {
  	// data object: {number:number,name:name,exp_date:{year:exp_year,month:exp_month}}
  });
